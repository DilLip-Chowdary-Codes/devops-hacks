## AWS

### CodeArtifact

#### Codeartifact Authentication automation:

Codeartifact authentication token will only valid for 12 hrs only, and to install/publish packages to codeartifact we need to authenticate again.

We used to run the codeartifact cli commands to authenticate when the token expires, now you can run the command generated by below script which will add the authencation commands to ~/.profile file, so that everytime you login to your device, codeartifact token will be updated.

Disclaimer: This will only work if you're working less than 12 hrs once login to developer system.

You can find the [script here](https://gist.github.com/DilLip-Chowdary-Codes/6d5e72546c62306b80d10df5befc97b4)
